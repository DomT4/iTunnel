iTunnel
=======

Fork of `iphonetunnel-usbmuxconnectbyport`, which was originally available at
`https://code.google.com/p/iphonetunnel-usbmuxconnectbyport` but seemingly
vanished when Google Code was archived.

**Please note this tool is known not to support iOS 11 or above.** Partly because
I mostly forked this project to keep it alive somewhere & partly because as the
`libimobiledevice` team have detailed [here](https://github.com/libimobiledevice/idevicerestore/commit/7336b600a160d731231d3ab05506e7be0c05f4e0)
and elsewhere, Apple has made it increasingly difficult to pull together the
required details this tool & similar tools need.

Never say never but _currently_ I've no intention of trying to add iOS 11+
support.
